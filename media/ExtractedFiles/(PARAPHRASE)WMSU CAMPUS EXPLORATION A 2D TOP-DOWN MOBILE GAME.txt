A 2D top -down mobile game called WMSU Campus Exploration  
Abstract  
If their university is large, freshmen have plenty of time to explore the campus for the first time. Prior to 
recently, the WMSU freshman enrolling procedure was a little challenging for new students. Even though 
that is the case, the majority of these freshmen are unfamiliar with the majority of the locations or 
structures on the WMSU campus. These first -year students can squander time at registration by trying to 
figure out where to go w hen the first day of class starts. Video games have been around for about 65 
years, and they can be played for fun, challenge, relaxation, or even boredom.  Because to its friendliness 
and ease of comprehension, it has gained enormous popularity among kids and teenagers. Video games 
have developed throughout the years in terms of gameplay, graphic design, and even user control. Since 
then, video games have evolved to the point that they can be utilized in place of something else. In order 
to address this iss ue, the study is creating a mobile game that allows players to perform missions related 
to the WMSU official freshman enrollment procedure and simulates the WMSU main campus in a 2 -
Dimensional TopDown graphic format.
