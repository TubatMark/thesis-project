 Abstract  
 
Over the past year’s cemeter ies are still constantly growing. With the cemetery still 
using traditional method of storing the deceased record, management can not keep up in 
tracking the location of the deceased, and can not properly maintain records and archives. 
This research then intends to develop an information management system for prope r 
storing of data with integration of a quantum geographic information system for grave 
mapping and location tracking  using  spatial algorithm . The fully functional system would 
help cemetery caretaker  or management, visitors, and researcher alike in making  
cemetery manageable. The study employed an applied research design, specifically a 
research and development design approach. Pre -evaluation and Beta -testing was made 
before and after the development , with beta -testing as a primary basis for the success of  
the system development. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire on 20 
convenient residents near the target cemetery. Result s showed that the developed system 
is beneficial in improving the cemetery management. Areas that mainly benefited from the  
system are grave tracking, data saving and record retrieving efficiency, and services 
options. Result s also showed the openness of the cemetery visitors and caretaker in 
adapting a new tool in making cemetery visit less problematic. Furthermore, r esult s made 
it clear that the lack of proper system management tool is what keeps the cemetery from 
being manageable. Therefore, further development in management tool is recommended 
in making the cemetery more manageable. Specifically, using a geographic inform ation 
system  technology.

 CHAPTER I  
Introduction  
 
Background of the Study  
 
A cemetery is a place where the remains of our loved ones – family, relatives, and 
friends are buried or interred. The term cemetery is derived from the Greek word 
'Koimeterion' which means a "sleeping place". Traditionally, we pay our respects to our 
loved ones in the cemetery  and pray for their souls.   
  
Most cemeteries today still use the traditional method of keeping records. They 
used to keep paper records, but these are especially vulnerable to damage and disaster. 
As a result, if these records are damaged or lost, it may be arduous to recover them. 
According to Cox and Day (2011), not all cemeteries allow equal access to anyone looking 
for a deceased person's record. Some helpful and friendly cemetery personnel, on the 
other hand, may provide the information free of charge , while others would charge fees 
that are higher than the cost of reviewing the deceased's records. In other cases, proof of 
relationship to the deceased would be required before disclosing the information.  Many 
nonprofit cemeteries do not have the staff o r resources to research burial records. 
Cemeteries without electronic records rely on old records most of the time, regardless of 
their condition, causing further degradation. If cemetery registers are digitized, there may 
be no established backup method i n place, which could lead to the loss of recent registers 
if the computer fails.  
  
Keeping records and mapping the cemetery is essential for visitors as it would 
allow easy access to the graves they are looking for and would provide a clear list of the 
parcels used and available for the cemetery. Mapping a gravesite or other sites can come 
with a few challenges. Their complexity may vary depending on the age of the site and 
the accuracy of the records. The only way to find unmarked graves is to dig or excav ate 
the site, which is not ideal. On the other hand, disturbed soils may be spotted, and tombs 
are marked using radar devices. This, however, would be impractical because it would 
necessitate experts and would take longer to locate the graves  
(Opus Blog, 2 020).  
 
2 | P a g e  
   
Many cemeteries are divided into sections for various cultures and religions. Each 
of these sections may be managed in a completely different manner. In Zamboanga city, 
there are unidentified graves in a Muslim public cemetery because the site is neglected, 
and no one from the family visits the graves. Furthermore, no one oversees the cemetery, 
whose graves are overgrown with tall grass and plants, making them difficult to locate; 
there is no technology to map the burial, and no one manages the dec eased's information 
or records.  
 
Statement of the problem  
 
A cemetery is a burial place where we bury our dead. A Muslim public cemetery in 
Barangay Mampang located in Zamboanga City is a non -profit cemetery that is not 
maintained by anyone. The site is neglected as the grasses and plants grow, making it 
difficult for visitors to locate the grave of their deceased.   
 
The goal of this research is to fill a void in Muslim cemeteries. The problems identified by 
the researchers are as follows:  
 
 The lack of a geo-mapping system to easily locate the graves of a specific dead 
person.  
 The absence of a records management system for proper maintenance and 
archiving of the records of the deceased.  
 
Objectives  
 
General Objectives  
The general objective of this research  is to develop a web -based system for grave 
mapping and record management for a Muslim cemetery.  
 
Specific Objectives  
To achieve the general objective, it is necessary to:  
 develop an information management system to store and search records of the 
deceased person's information;  
 
3 | P a g e  
  integrate a web map using quantum geographic information system (QGIS) to 
enable grave mapping;  
 use a spatial algorithm that organizes geometric data for efficient search; and,  
 to evaluate the design, reliability, efficiency,  and user -friendliness of the system.  
 
Scope and Limitation  
The research is limited to a web -based management system with the primary features of 
searching for deceased information and digital plotting of graves. Provision to mark plots 
and set them as eit her occupied or available, the system used open -source geographic 
information system (GIS) technology. The system could only be used in Muslim 
cemeteries and is used for graveyards.  
The target user and respondents of the research are the Admin and the ceme tery visitors 
of the Muslim Cemetery of Zamboanga City, regardless of religion. Supposedly, the 
respondents of this research were Muslim cemetery visitors, but due to the covid -19 
pandemic, the respondent was randomly chosen.  
The software used for buildin g the system were the following: Vs Code as IDE alongside 
the latest HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL web programming technology.  
Significance  
          
The research result would be beneficial or significant to:   
 Administrator/Cemetery Caretaker – This system provides practical assistance in 
managing the Muslim cemetery and significantly contribute to the client's easy 
access and reference of information. Furthermore, to increase the cemetery's 
sales in service offered.  
 Cemetery visitors/Customers – The system would help the Visitor/customer lessen 
the time locating the graves and knowing the other services provided.  
 Researchers – The study would aid or serve as a reference for future research into 
a similar topic involving cemeteries and the usefulness o f information management 
systems as a solution.  
 
4 | P a g e  
  Future Researcher - Future researchers with the same account as the one used 
during this study might be able to obtain incite and materials for their prospect 
study.

 CHAPTER II 
Review of Related Literature  
 
Related Literature  
 
Short history, Impact, and Development of Cemeteries  
 
Philippine cemetery architecture spans more than three and a half centuries. It 
started from rocks and cave cemeteries, and it was before the Spanish rule and American 
intervention. Some cemeteries are sometimes permanently built beside or around 
churches or Mosques. Even today, some cemeteries are still noticeable near churches 
and Mosques. Burial is always associated with the church because of burial ceremonies 
and pra yers. Today, cemetery development is evident, dating back to the long period of 
Spanish rule (1565 -1898). Cemeteries keep changing due to or maybe because of 
Philippine cultural and burial practices. Because of the country's development, capital 
cities inn ovate to establish modern cemeteries. Although development means qualitative 
change, which is always good, cemetery development is not always positive. The best 
example is unplanned development. Unplanned development, especially in cemeteries, 
can hinder t he growth of urban places. According to Soliman, A. (2015), who did the 
studies on "Impact of cemeteries on the development of urban settlements in Egypt," 
cemetery planning is essential. It should consider the legal, moral, and religious needs of 
society.  Creating guidelines and principles would help prepare for future urban and 
cemetery development structural plans in selecting cemetery sites.  
  
Information Management System  
 
Businesses nowadays are supported by information systems for data 
management, including storing, searching, and analyzing incoming and outgoing data. 
The primary uses of the information system are for decision -making, control, analysis, and 
visualization o f information in an organization. An information system is essential in an 
organization because it makes the communication process much more efficient. 
Businesses gain cost advantages over competitors. Reports can give insights and ideas 
for a plan or stra tegy. It also helps in decision -making by modeling the information and 
results of decisions and calculating possibilities. The record helps reflect, analyze, and 
 
6 | P a g e  
 forecast action for the future. The primary objective of using management information 
systems is to manage and meet the growing and diverse needs of staff, customers, and 
the community. Information systems have been around for a long time. Of course, we, 
humans, are the backbone of the information system, and our desire, passion, and needs 
are the driving force of its development and innovation. Modern technology like the 
management information system would benefit businesses and help them ride the rising 
flow of growth and innovation.  
One of the institutions or businesses that need information sys tems is the 
cemetery. The cemetery represents the history of our land and the resting place for our 
deceased family members. Although the cemetery is considered a sacred place, it is also 
a source of income for somebody. The caretaker or cemetery manager s ells plots with 
indefinite care, cutting or trimming grass, caring for the headstone or markers, and 
maintaining anything associated with that grave. However, cemetery management gets 
problematic when a cemetery is not in a manageable state. For example, s earching for 
log records could take a long time if a person wants to see how many empty spaces there 
are with the manual records. The worst is calculating it by looking around or patrolling the 
cemetery, which is inefficient. These problems make the job of  managing complex and 
wasteful. However, all problem has a solution because, based on an article published in 
the campsite (2015), why cemeteries should need management software, the author 
stated that software would provide management with the benefits li sted below;  
 Quick Record searches - as it makes work simplified, organized, and efficient.  
 Quick gravesite navigation guides visitors to the grave's exact location.  
 Secure record - back up all documents and control who has access to the data.  
With the sup port of a management information system, the difficulty of the management 
work can be easily flipped and take the management to a new level. When the information 
system establishes a connection between the physical location of the cemetery and the 
data col lected, Using the Geographic cemetery mapping system formed. Before jumping 
into potential solutions, a discussion should be done first on cemetery structure and 
characteristics for modification or adjustment.  
 
Cemetery Types  
 
There are many types of cemet eries with varying levels of services and options. 
Each type of cemetery is designed based on religion, culture, and tradition. The changes 
 
7 | P a g e  
 in both burial tradition and legal issues have led to the creation of different types of 
cemeteries. However, regard less of cemetery type, cemeteries are considered sacred 
places collectively. The kinds of cemetery we have are; [a]Monumental cemeteries or 
monument cemetery, is a traditional cemetery that feature upright headstones and 
typically made of granite, marble o r stone and bronze, [b]Memorial park, is a lawn -level 
memorial type that looks like a park or garden, [c]Garden cemetery, is a combination 
upright monument and with a garden or nature feel, [d]Religious cemeteries, is a specific 
cemetery for specific commu nity, Muslim and Christian cemetery are examples of religious 
cemetery, [e]Municipal cemeteries, is simply a cemetery owned by a local city, [f]Natural 
burial ground, emphasize minimal environmental impact funeral and burial practices, 
[g]Green burial, is a certified and monitored natural burial ground, [h]VA cemeteries, is a 
type of cemetery owned, operated and controls by the Veterans Affair Administration, 
[i]Graveyard, is a burial ground attached to or associated with the church or Mosque, and 
is very c ommon burial ground in the Philippines, lastly the [j]Family burial ground, is a 
private land designated for burial of members of the same family. Different cemeteries 
also serve various services with histories and other policies, practices, and rules and 
regulations. In the Philippines, the most common cemeteries are public cemeteries, 
Religious cemeteries, District or municipal cemeteries, and cemeteries for veterans or 
nationals. Preparing burial sites, placing the dead body in the grave, installing grav e 
markers or headstones, and sometimes having a crematorium and funeral parlor are all 
standard services and responsibilities of cemeteries.  
Furthermore, cemeteries are required to save the person's burial documents and 
maintain the grave -site indefinitely. All cemeteries have also shared similar visitors, burial 
planners, familiar visitors like individuals, and families. The Common problem of 
cemeteries is that the dissemination of information is slow, and visitor inquiries are 
sometimes not m et. Even though cemeteries have different types and services, they still 
have similar problems.  
 
Geographic Information System (GIS)  
 
Geographic Information System, or the GIS, is a framework for communicating, 
organizing, and understanding the science of our world. GIS is used to make maps that 
display, perform analysis, share information, and are used to solve complex problems 
across t he globe. Simply, GIS is changing the way our world works. Geographic 
information system technology applies geographic science with tools for understanding 
 
8 | P a g e  
 and collaboration. GIS helps an organization or even an individual understand patterns 
and relations hips.  
In 1832, a French geographer named Charles Picquet utilized different color 
gradients on a map of Paris to show the number of cholera deaths, providing an early 
contribution to epidemiology. Twenty -two years later, English physician John Snow took 
this concept further and demonstrated the problem -solving potential of maps by identifying 
the connection between an outbreak of cholera in London and a contaminated water 
supply. Today, GIS has various applications. Over the history of geographic informatio n 
systems, researchers, analysts, and programmers have continued to innovate, develop, 
and enhance the GIS further. It led to a technological breakthrough that we now have (i.e., 
navigations, banking, geology, surveying, mapping, and many more). GIS has pl ayed an 
essential role in business, industry, work, and everyday life.  
 
Related Studies  
 
Foreign Studies  
 
Few studies have utilized geographical information systems to help analyze the 
cemetery, structures, landscape, and grave location. They obtained a formula to generate 
data analysis from GIS using  the data. J. Pritsolas and G. Acheson (2017) determined 
that GIS effectively documented, analyzed, and mapped the cemetery. Reading a few 
lines of their research would lead readers to believe that cemetery d evelopment is 
impossible without precise data, appropriate tools, and effective management. Lotfi S., 
Habibi K., and Koohsari M. (2008) used geography and urban land structure to formulate 
a multi -criteria model to determine an excellent site to build a ce metery. They integrated 
the GIS and AHP or the analytic hierarchy process to filter factors, alternatives, and others 
that might get involved in selecting a site. The studies can potentially be used as a pre -
selection tool when planning to build a proper c emetery. Some may disagree with their 
ranking of the importance of the elements they used to weigh their chosen sites. However, 
the studies are detailed enough to prove their effectiveness.  
Some cemeteries are already considered historic because of the age  of their 
structures. For instance, Abbot J.S.'s research (2012) took place in a graveyard in the 
Georgian capital of Athens. The cemetery was long considered historical. Their studies 
defined a historic landscape's importance, even though it is a cemetery . Their studies tried 
to discover appropriate strategies and possible solutions to improve the current 
 
9 | P a g e  
 management approach at the cemetery. They studied the historical context of the place, 
its existing management structure, and the current management issu es. Eventually, it 
came up with a model that could solve the problems of the management approach of the 
cemetery manager.  
The Cemetery Information System is the one with good features. The research 
data can be shareable with both internal and external univ ersities. The system's key 
features include reducing visitor confusion and workload, delivering information to staff 
and citizens via the internet, and collecting the output of the ideal path by optimum path 
analysis and the main spots in the cemetery on t he map (Sefa S. et al.2017). It was the 
closest foreign study similar to the proposed research. Furthermore, the researcher tried 
to provide as much as the current studies have and improve the performance and quality 
of work in the target cemetery.  
Feature s standard in some previous studies is almost the same as manual records 
and information management. Many studies focus on cemetery changes over the past 
decades rather than control. They left only a few studies and research material discussing 
cemetery in formation management. However, the researcher noticed that GIS is evident 
in each study and research material on cemetery information management.  
 
Local Studies  
 
The proponent studied the memorial park business in a study by Fortunato et al.  
(2009) entitled Geographic Information System for St. Francis of Assisi Memorial Park. 
After a few reviews, they came up with the right features that may help manage the 
memorial park business. The said features are; customer status identification, faster 
transac tions using the system, providing accurate data, viewing the park's geographic 
location, and generating accurate reports.  
The study by Baldano et al. (2014) propose d an Online Geographical Information 
System for J. Bacolod Realty. The study mainly focuses on helping users find low prices 
but beautiful houses and lots using only smartphones and internet connections. 
Geographic Information System were also similar to the Heaven Peace Memorial Garden 
Online Information System research.  
Heaven Peace Memorial Garden Online Information System disseminates 
information to promote the memorial garden using online communication rather than the 
previous method of promoting the place, using flyers and billboards. The stud y focused 
on the cemetery management of a priva te memorial garden. Inspired by the advancement 
 
10 | P a g e  
 of modern technology and the problems regarding locating graves . Researcher  came up 
with the idea of having an Online Cemetery Management. The researcher gathered the 
necessary data to provide accurate inform ation for the success of the research. The 
study's main objective is; to give the customer and the management an easier way of 
locating graves. This objective would help to have an easier way of disseminating 
information using an Online System to help them  increase their sales through an Online 
System ( Arevalo et al., 2009). 
Every study requires location analysis, structure, and management. It was evident 
that technological tools such as GIS, Web Development Tool, and other Software 
Development technologies are just blessings. Customers' desire for more and new 
services is increasing as a business grows. There may be hacking, technical errors, and 
a lack of expertise and experience using technology. However, studies have proven that 
venturing or adopting tech nology in business benefits both the customer and the business 
owner. During these studies, researchers planned, strategized, and reviewed each 
possible solution and tool that the researchers could utilize to support our target users and 
institution.    
 
Waterfall Model  
 
The first Process Model to consider was the Waterfall Model. It was also 
considered a linear -sequential life cycle model and is straightforward to understand and 
use. In a waterfall paradigm, each phase must work and complete before moving  on to 
the next. There are no stages that overlap. The waterfall approach was the first SDLC 
Model used widely in Software Engineering to ensure the project's success. In "The 
Waterfall" approach, the software development process separates phases into diff erent 
steps. Typically, the outcome of one step acts as the input for the following stage in this 
Waterfall approach. The following diagram denotes the various phases of the Waterfall 
Model.  
 
 
11 | P a g e  
  
FIGURE 1: WATERFALL MODEL  
 
The researcher considered using the waterfall model because of its simplicity. The 
phases are easy to follow but require a bit of modification. Hence, the researcher came 
up with the idea of using the iterative waterfall model. This idea would allow the resear cher 
to step back and polish the system in development or any part of the phase. The waterfall 
model maximized the usage of data collection (pre -evaluation and beta -testing). The 
iterative feature allows heading back and fixing or modifying anything needed  in that 
phase.  
 
Spatial Algorithm  
 
The researcher use d a Spatial algorithm in this research because it deals with 
geometric data. Geometric data is a spatial data type mapped on a two -dimensional flat 
surface. Spatial indices are a family of algorithms that arrange geometric data for efficient 
search. For exa mple, doing queries like "return all buildings in this area," "find 1000 closest 
gas stations to this point", and returning results within milliseconds even when searching 
millions of objects. Spatial data can have any number of attributes about a location . For 
example, this may be a map, photographs, historical information, or anything else that 
may be deemed necessary. Users can save spatial data in various formats, as it can also 

 
12 | P a g e  
 contain more than location -specific data. Analyzing this data provides a be tter 
understanding of how each variable impacts individuals, communities, and populations.  
There are several spatial data types, but the two primary kinds of spatial data are 
geometric and geographic data.  
 Geometric data  is a spatial data type mapped on a two-dimensional flat surface. 
One example is the geometric data in floor plans. Another example of spatial data 
in action is Google Maps, which uses geometric data to provide accurate direction.  
 Geographic data  is information mapped around a sphere. Most o ften, the globe 
is planet earth. Geographic data highlights the latitude and longitude relationships 
to a specific object or location. A familiar example of geographic information is a 
global positioning system.

Cemetery Mapping Informatio n System  
 
The purpose of the "Cemetery Mapping Information System" was to create a 
platform that would make it easier for users to find the graves of their loved ones and for 
personnel to efficiently access, update, and maintain the data. The system allows  users 
and personnel to type in the name of the deceased person and displays information about 
them, including their location. The current system for locating and recording this 
information is time -consuming and requires a lot of effort, but the new system  aims to 
make it more efficient and user -friendly.  
 
Cemetery Information System: A Case Study in Sivas City  
   
Cemetery Information System (CIS) is a case study in Sivas City. The case study 
aimed to provide better quality services to the citizen to satisfy the city's religious and 
spiritual needs. The study aims to help people find their relatives' graves quickly. Using 
GIS would shorten the time to find the tomb of their loved ones. Having the output of the 
optimum path analysis and the main points in the cemetery on the map would decrease 
the confusion in finding their relatives' graves. Workload during a special event would 
provide online information for staff and citizens through the internet and Geographical 
planning for future burials in the cem eteries. The study used the designed system to 
transfer thousands of deceased records to the database.  
 
13 | P a g e  
           The Cemetery Information System (CIS) provides a better quality of service to the 
people of Sivas City. With this study, cemetery works, one of the most critical, complex, 
and indispensable activities in municipalities, have been solved with the help of GIS and 
presented to the service of citizens. One of the essential features of this work is the 
development of a platform -independent web -based application. With the help of ArcMap, 
the CIS is a success.  
 
 
Comparison of Features  
 
TABLE 1: COMPARISON OF FEATURE  
 
The table displays the comparison of features from recent studies. These will serve 
as a basis for what features can be added and what features can be further developed for 
future studies. Based on the comparison, almost all recent studies relating to cemetery 
management have in corporated GIS technology. This study will use QGIS and web 
technologies to develop an improved solution for cemetery management.

 Conceptual Framework  
 
 
FIGURE 2: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE SYSTEM  
 
The study's primary purpose is  to visualize the cemetery record spatially and make 
it fast to track and locate where the deceased is residing. No existing tools, descriptions, 
or documents could help organize cemetery dead records and their graves in the target 
scope of the study. The deceased personal information must be inputted and saved in the 
system to verify and avoid falsification and duplication, confusing the record pool. The 
spatial algorithm then passes on to assign or merge the data into its designated spatial 
location befor e permanently storing it in the database. The spatial algorithm arranges and 
references geometric data to a specific area or location. As a result, the record can be 
viewed and accessed in a spatial form, which is much more efficient and appropriate for 
a cemetery.

 CHAPTER III 
Methodology  
 
Introduction  
 
This chapter discussed the research design, research locale, population and 
sampling, research instrument, instrument's validity, data gathering procedure, and 
statistical tool, which are relevant to the study. This chapter explains the research and 
software methodology in detail.  
 
Research Design  
 
This study employed  Applied Research Design, specifically, a Research and 
Development Design. As a result, the development held on to the research or relevant 
facts from the study of the target population or the system/project implementation location. 
The primary reason why this study would be using research and development design is 
because of the following:  
 to maximize the conne ction and usability between the research design and 
software methodology (refer to Figure 7).  
 to guarantee the usability of the system/project.  
 
Research Method   
 
The study employed both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The 
researcher used the qualitative research method to understand the topic further and 
identify relevant data by interviewing local Muslims about their experiences with the 
current or existing cemetery management. At the same time, a quantitative research 
method to measure a nd understand the general ideas, experiences, and responses during 
the pre -evaluation and beta testing of the proposed solution using a survey questionnaire.  
 
Research Locale  
 
This research aimed to improve the storage and retrieval of records and the over all 
management of Muslim cemeteries in Zamboanga City, particularly the Mampang Muslim 
Public Cemetery. As a result, the data would come from within Zamboanga City.  
 
16 | P a g e  
 Population and Sampling  
 
Due to the government's strict protocol implemented because of the  pandemic, the 
researcher slightly shifted the specification for pre -evaluation. Non -Muslims are now 
considered a participant in the current public cemetery management re -evaluation. 
Regardless of religion, as long as they have deceased relatives or family  members buried 
in a grave -type cemetery. The criteria for selecting participants are the following:  
 willing to participate  
 had deceased relative, family member, or friends buried in a grave type cemetery  
 be of any or either sex and religion  
 at least 18 years old or older

The sampling technique  that was  used in this study is a convenience sampling 
technique. It is a sampling technique  that consider s the researcher ’s demography and 
capability. The total number of respondents convenient and willing to participate was 23, 
with nine males who account for 39.1% population, 13 females or 56.5% of the total 
population, and one gay participant or 4.3% of the total populatio n (see table 2). These 
samples were willing to participate in the research during a week -long data gathering.  
 
 
17 | P a g e  
 Table 3 shows six (6) male and fourteen (14) female respondents participated in 
the beta testing. Males account for 30%, and females account for 70% of the total 
population.  
 
Research Instrument  
  
Pre-evaluation utilized a questionnaire as the research instrument, combining 
printed and online Google forms, to draw out essential data from the respondents. The 
questionnaire contained several questions that rate the satisfaction level of cemetery 
visitors and questions that would draw out critical data to figure out problems of the current 
cemetery management. The questionnaire has two parts: the respondent demographic 
and survey questions (see  Appendix B).  
 
Post-evaluation or beta testing also utilized a questionnaire as an instrument. The 
question is open -ended to understand how they perceive our project. The researcher 
assists the respondent in recording and transcribing their responses.

Rate interpretation had used a Five -point liker scale to understand respondents' 
feedback to the System Beta Testing. Five (5) was the highest point with an adjectival 
understanding of "Strongly Agree." Followed by four (4) as "Agree," three (3) as "Slightly 
Agree," two (2) as "Slightly Disagree, and one (1) as being the lowest with an adjectival 
interpretation of "Strongly Disagree."

 Validity of the Instrument  
 
The instrument utilized in this study was content -validated and reviewed by the research 
adviser and research review committee for mass data collectio n without causing any 
unnecessary problems.  
 
Data Gathering Procedure  
 
The researcher conducted the data gathering during the early planning phase. It 
started with the pre -evaluation to acquire relevant data to determine the problem further 
and kickstart the study. Survey questionnaire was used to obtain the necessary data. It 
was handed out or disseminated using online messaging apps and emails. The researcher 
also conducted a short interview in the local barangay of Mampang with the Muslim elders 
as an i nterviewee. The researcher asked several elders who voluntarily responded to the 
discussion. It is to ascertain some beliefs of Muslims that may be related to or may affect 
the development of the system/project. Lastly, the researcher conducted beta testin g after 
developing the system/project. Like the pre -evaluation, Beta testing also used online 
messaging apps and emails. Questions such as design, usability, reliability, efficiency, 
and user -friendliness are software -related. Instruction was provided clea rly in the 
beginning section for the participant to answer the survey questionnaire accurately. It was 
conducted for a week -long period while being assisted by the researchers.  
  
Statistical Tool  
 
Descriptive statistics  – the study used descriptive statist ics quantitatively summarize the 
information or data from the beta testing.  
Central tendency  – used to get the probability value distribution.  
Mean  – used to get the arithmetic average of the data collected during the beta testing.  
 
Analytical Tools  
 
Flowchart  - The algorithm used in mapping and how the search feature acts, which is 
critical in the system/project, were plotted using a flowchart. A flowchart is a diagram that 
represents a process.  
 
 
19 | P a g e  
 Software Development Methodology  – This is a structured  process engaged when 
working on a project. This study's software development methodology combines the 
Iterative Waterfall method and the one -group pre -evaluation and beta -test method.  
Use Case – was used during the design phase to present the flow of the system 
processes. The use case is a set of a possible sequences of interaction between the users 
and the system.  
Logical Entity Relationship Diagram -The logical ERD was used during the study's 
design phase to understand the data used in the system project . It depicts the relationship 
among each data.  
 
System Architecture  
 
 
FIGURE 3: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OF THE PROJECT  
 
A layered architecture describes the interface, processing, and data layer of the 
system project; the interface layer is the request of the customer or admin to see the record 
or map from the database. Front -end web technology such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
and QGIS web components are the tools used to create the interface. The processing 
layer processes the request  of the users and asks for information from the data layer. On 
the other hand, the data layer stores the people's records and map information and stores 
persistent information or files such as images and documents .

 CHAPTER IV 
Results and Discussions  
 
Management Information System Development  
 
The following section discusses how the system was built, from the data gathering 
to testing. As one of the research objectives, the system was carefully built based on the 
pre-evaluation and guidance from the res earcher’s professors. For the system UI/UX, 
please refer to (appendix a).   
 
System Processes and Flow  
 
The algorithm  was used in translating  the behavior of search feature of the system , 
which is critical in the system/project  were plotted using a flowchart.  
 
 
 
FIGURE 4: FLOWCHART FOR MAPPING PROCESSES  

 
21 | P a g e  
 When a customer wishes to have an account, the Customer should sign up first. 
The system would check whether the account is new or existing. The new account should 
provide the necessary information, such as deceased personal information before they 
can avail graveyards and services the cemetery offers. After giving the essential 
information and choosing a grave location, the Customer should wait for validation, and 
this is t o validate if the chosen grave is available.  A registered account could directly 
access the different services offered by the management and also search publicly and 
their corresponding location on the map.  
 
 
 
FIGURE 5: FLOWCHART FOR SEARCH RECORD PROCESSES  
 
This flowchart shows the process of searching by the Users/Customers. When a 
customer randomly searches for deceased information or a grave location, the system 

 
22 | P a g e  
 would automatically determine  if the user is a logged -in user or n ot. Users that are not 
registered or do not have an account can only view limited information or records that are 
for the public. Meanwhile, suppose the other user searches for a particular individual 
registered in the system, and the system does not show the deceased individual's record. 
In that case, the specific user sets their status to Private. No one can view private 
information but the owner only.  
 
Project Plan/SDLC Model  
 
In operating the system, the researchers used the software development cycle 
(SDLC), the overall process that consists of six cycles. The first is to determine the 
requirement. The researcher should decide what software and hardware technology the 
team would procure to develop and implement the proposed system during this cycle. Th e 
second is to gather data: this is where the researcher interviews the management office 
to collect data that could help the system's operation. The third step is to analyze the data. 
In this cycle, the researcher explored all the gathered data to identif y the necessary 
information to develop the proposed system and give solutions. Next would be the phase 
of designing. The researcher designed a system related to the research problem, the 
specification, and operation with detail and some conceptual models o f the user 
requirements. The last cycle would be the coding. The researcher encoded all the codes 
with the hand of the technical expert to check if they had an error or if the program would 
debug successfully. The project undergoes some testing to determin e if the data is 
reliable. Maintaining the system is also part of it and also giving solutions.  
 
Software Development Methodology  
 
The study's software development methodology combines the Iterative Waterfall 
method and the one -group pre -evaluation and beta -test method. The researcher chose 
this method to make modifications after the post or beta testing or each phase for better 
developm ent and improvement of the system. It is also relevant because the research 
design and research method use research and development methodology design.

DESIGN  
 
Phase 1: Requirement Analysis  
 
This phase covered the task conducted, such as defining the problem and 
objective, extensive literature review, and pre -evaluation for the target user. The following 
are the requirement from the system based o n the data gathered and interpreted during 
the study:  
 The system should be able to record the information of the deceased in the 
cemetery  
 The system should be able to map or set the deceased's record in the proper 
grave.  
 The system must allow the customer to view the information and tomb of the dead.  
 The system should be able to cater to cemetery services that are helpful to the 
customer.  
 The system must notify the customer regarding completing the services they have 
requested.  
 

 
24 | P a g e  
 Phase 2 Design   
 
The researcher uses the requirement specification from the first phase to prepare 
the system design, use case, flowchart, and an entity -relationship diagram of the proposed 
system.  
Use Case (UC) - was used during the design phase to present the flow of the sys tem 
processes.

FIGURE 8: LOGICAL ERD OF THE SYSTEM PROJECT  
 
The registration entity would store the customer account information. A single 
account can record or register a maximum of three users, and the record entity would hold 
the data of the deceased. Single or many records can share a single plot, with a maximum 
of three records per grave. The plot entity or table would store the plot area, plot numb er, 
and plot availability. In contrast, the services entity would house the management or 
supplied services. A single account can use one or more services for many records or 
graves.  
 
Phase 3 Coding  
 
This phase covered the development, the required tools, and the components 
necessary to accomplish the system development.  
 
  

 
27 | P a g e  
 Development Tools  
 
 There are two groups of tools that the developer has used. The first set of tools 
was for mapping or graphing maps, and the second set of tools was for web development. 
The tools  used are as follows:  
● QGIS – a free and open -source Quantum Geographic Information System.  
● Photoshop – is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc.  
● Visual Studio Code – a code editor redefined and optimize d for building and 
debugging modern web and cloud applications.  
● Google Earth Pro – Used to import and export GIS data.  
 
GIS Components  
 
 This study requires GIS technology to visualize and interpret data in the form of 
maps. GIS is an organized collection  of computer hardware, software, geographic data, 
method, and personnel. The components are as follows:  
 
 
FIGURE 9: GIS COMPONENTS  
  
 
● Hardware - hardware is the computer on which the GIS operates. There is a wide 
range of hardware  types, from centralized to standalone. GIS runs on almost every 
hardware type.  

 
28 | P a g e  
 ● Software - The GIS software provides the functions and tools needed to analyze, 
store, and display geographic information. The components of the software are as 
follows:  
o Databa se 
o input and output tools  
o query, analysis, and visualization tools  
o GUI tools  
● People - manage the system and devise plans for applying it.  
● Methods - Designed plans, models, and operating practices are the basis of a 
successful GIS operation.  
● Data - The most  critical component of the GIS. The data the GIS operates on 
consists of any data bearing a definable relationship to space, including any data 
about things and events that occur in nature. GIS mainly employs DBMS to create 
and maintain databases to help o rganize and manage data.  
 
Phase 4 Testing  
 
This phase is limited to the testing of the system and consultation with the tester. 
The researcher implemented a beta -testing to ensure that the system was working 
correctly. A  questionnaire  was used as an instrument for beta testing. The questions are 
consisted of concerned with the system's user interface, user -friendliness, usefulness, 
reliability, and efficiency. The testing results could guide the implementation processes.  
 
Phase 5 Opera tion 
 
This phase has covered the training for the personnel who w ould be handl ing the 
system from behind. The researcher had monito red the outcome, perform a comparison 
or post -evaluation test, and analyze s the result.   
 
Hardware Requirement  
 
The minimum system requirement for the user and client are the following:  
 CPU of Pentium 4 or newer  
 RAM of 4GB  
 
29 | P a g e  
  Storage space of at least 500MB  
          
Software Requirement  
 
The minimum software requirements for the end -users are the following:  
 Window 7 OS or newer  
 Mac OS 10.12 or newer  
 Android version of 5.0 or newer  
 iOS version 11.4 or newer  
 
Network Requirement  
 
The minimum network speed or bandwidth is 500kbps or higher.  But higher 
network speed is recommended as the system have uses several  geo-mapping 
technologies.  
 
Phase 6 Maintenance  
 
This phase covered the actions done to fix the issues regarding the system's 
deployment in the client environment and concluded the study.  
 
System implementation  
 
The proposed system, the cemetery mapping, and the information system were 
presented for the end -user to find their deceased relatives easily and worry -free. A 
representative in the group of researchers provided questionnaires to answer the 
questions, clarification, and difficulties that could aris e upon operating the proposed 
system.   
 
Integrating the Web -Map using QGIS into the MIS  
 
Researchers used the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) to create 
a map to locate the deceased person's grave in the system visually. The Researcher 
utilized  the Spatial Algorithm to implement the project for searching and storing of dead 
person's data using information such as the deceased person's name, date of birth, and 
date of death.

 QGIS Browser Essential  
 
 
FIGURE 10: QGIS BROWSER ESSENTIALS  
 
 The most essential extension that is needed in developing a grave map is the 
vector tiles which will be used in creating the markers, and also the XYZ Tiles or the 
satellites which is necessary in figuring out the exact location of the  graves via satellite 
view. The other extensions are installed by default by QGIS.

They are separated by colors, green indicate a vacant grave, while orange 
indicate an occupied grave.  
 Road – road layer are the pitch -colored large lines that indicate a road. Its 
primary purpose is to give visitor an idea of different possible routes.  
 Cemetery Cir cumference – is the overall size of the cemetery, and where 
plotting is allowed.  
 Google Satellite – is used as an extension to have a clear view of the 
entirety of the cemetery, which makes it easy to plot grave markings.  
 
 
FIGURE 12: QGIS EXPORT FEATURE  
 
 One of the greatest features of QGIS 3 is that they allow you to export the map 
that was created in their software. When a map is exported as a web map, it w ould then  
convert the layers, together with the necessary extensions in browser into JavaScript, 
Json, and CSS codes. They are originally a raster file when they are in QGIS. The detailed 
conversion are as follows:  

 
32 | P a g e  
  Markers Layer  Image Files, and JS File  
 Circumference Layer  Image Files, JS File  
 Road Layer  Image Files, JS File 
 Google Satellite  API 
The next thing would be linking them together with the MIS, which is done using 
the common tags in html such as:  
 <link> Tag – which is commonly used to link a CSS file.  
 <script></script> Tag – which is commonly used to link a JS  file. 
 
Result of using QGIS  
 
QGIS, in comparison to other GIS frameworks,  loads faster and performs 
processes in a smaller amount of time. The researcher created a web map using QGIS to 
respond to the study's stated problem: the lack of a geo -mapping system for locating a 
specific deceased person's grave.

Usability  Grave search , and grave map is very helpful.  
Reliability  The grave image is helpful to quickly find the grave.  
Efficiency  Easy to search the record of the deceased person.  
User -friendliness  Cemetery map function such as, zoom -in, zoom -out, search, and 
location tracker are simple to use.  
 
The problem of locating the grave of a particular deceased individual on a map 
was solved using the spatial method.

 Spatial Algorithm for Efficient Search  
 
The spatial algorithm was the most efficient when dealing with extensive spatial 
data or objects, mainly because of spat ial indices used by spatial databases to optimize 
spatial queries.  
Spatial indices are a family of algorithms that arrange geometric data for efficient 
search. For example, doing queries like “return all buildings in this area,” “find 1000 closest 
gas sta tions to this point”, and returning results within milliseconds even when searching 
millions of objects (Agafonkin, 2018).  
The researcher implemented the QGIS algorithm provider, which also supports the 
creation of spatial index under the vector category.  The algorithm from this provider would 
work without any additional configuration. Nevertheless, the researcher modified the target 
component when searching for spatial data to fit into the research objectives; the property 
name is used instead of using ca rtesian (complex and lengthy numerical data) (fig.13).   
 
 
FIGURE 13: CORE COMPONENT OF SPATIAL SEARCH ALGORITM  
 
This intuitive approach searches the raw data for spatial data and vice versa to 
develop a result efficiently and faster. As a result, even searching with thousands or 
hundred thousand records, the result would arrive more quickly.  The researcher exported 
the search algorithm in a JS file based on the QGIS pre -built spatial algorithm.  
 
Result of Beta Testing  
 
Each piece of content is rated on a Likert scale of 1 to 5. The highest possible 
score is five (5) with a verbal interpretation of "Strongly Agree," while the lowest point is 
one (1) with a verbal interpretation of "Strongly Disagree." The verbal interpretation  for the 
four (4) points is "Agree," three (3) points for "Slightly Agree," and two (2) points for 
"Slightly Disagree." The information gathered is shown below.

Discussion  
 
Beta Test Evaluation  
 
Based on the data presented in chapter 4, most respondents rated "Agree" on the 
design category with the mean value of 4.1, with an interpretation of "Agree." They were 
 
39 | P a g e  
 able to like the Color of the background and icons and the visibility of the icons. At the 
same time, some of the respondents rated "Strongly Agree" and "Slightly Agree." Most 
respondents rated "Strongly Agree" in most statements in the Usability category and rated 
4.49 mean value with and interpreting "Strongly Agree." They could see the sy stem's 
effectiveness, particularly with the grave's map, searching for records, and requesting 
services. Some of the respondents rated "Agree" and "Slightly Agree." The system 
Reliability got a mean value of 4.21 with an interpretation of "Strongly Agree."  They were 
able to determine the system's dependability. The image in each grave is reliable in 
locating the grave, and some respondents rated "Agree" and "Slightly Agree." Most 
respondents rated "Strongly Agree" in most statements in the Efficiency catego ry, with a 
mean value of 4.47 interpreted as "Strongly Agree." The respondent could determine the 
system's efficiency regarding how fast searching for the grave and the searching for a 
deceased person was. The User -friendliness category got a mean value of  3.85 with an 
interpretation of "Agree." The respondent could see the system's ease of use, particularly 
in zooming in and out, searching, and location tracking.  
 
Application of QGIS and Spatial Algorithm Evaluation  
 
Based on the overall evaluation in beta  testing, applying GIS and Spatial 
algorithms to the system was advantageous. GIS notably raised the efficiency, user -
friendliness, and reliability of the system using live maps and grave tracker. At the same 
time, the spatial algorithm lessens the searchi ng time to find a specific record. Based on 
the response of some respondents, searching was fast enough to their liking. It was good 
enough because the execution time was supposed to be slow. Not to mention the 
involvement of objects and live satellite map s, which are factors to be considered in 
calculating the execution time.

 CHAPTER V 
Conclusions and Recommendations  
 
Conclusion  
 
 The research findings reveal that a fully functional web -based geo -mapping 
system is ideal. Because of how accessible and efficient it is, research results generated 
substantial interest and openness to the user, which proved that the perfect method of 
management for the cemetery is geo -mapping.  
The store and search record features have significantly increased the efficiency of 
obtaining and inserting new deceased data. The result showed a great usability level, and 
that was made possible because of these features.  
Research findings also reveal that geo -mapping top with the spatial algorithm for 
data search has the highest significance to the success of this research. It has a 
tremendous impact on the outcome of the system by increasing the search time of the 
record and increasing search outcome accuracy by displaying the data in a geo -map.  
The final evaluation reveals that the research has proven that geo -mapping is the 
most suitable tool for cemetery management. It also showed that the research project is  
fully functional and usable, which is the general objective of this study. Collaborative use 
of QGIS, GIS, and Spatial Algorithms are undeniably the most effective and efficient tools 
for a geo -mapping system.  
 
Recommendation  
 
Since cemeteries continue to  use outdated data recording methods, the researcher 
advised that they adopt an information system tool to maintain order. A fully functional 
system can aid management and even visitors in making visiting cemeteries less difficult. 
When fully operational, the system will enable visitors to find the grave they intended to 
visit with just a few taps on their mobile devices.  
The management must effectively use a geo -mapping system in plotting the grave 
with their necessary and assigned identification to preven t grave stacking, 
misidentification, and grave loss. Additionally, it is advisable to include images that visitors 
can use as a guide to help them find their visiting graves.  
 
41 | P a g e  
 For future researchers, if they also plan to develop a geo -mapping system. It is 
advisable to use the spatial algorithm since it is the fastest searching algorithm when 
working with spatial indices. When the retrieval of geometric data takes longer than is 
recommended for it to arrive, a geo -mapping system will become pointless. With a  spatial 
algorithm, spatial searching would only take a couple of seconds regardless of how many 
spatial indices are in the database.  
A cemetery -related online service should be integrated into the system, as well. 
The management could use this additional income to cover costs associated with 
operating and maintaining the cemetery. Online scheduling of services would reduce the 
number of visitors who bring their sharp objects into cemeteries; this feature also helps 
ensure other visitors' safety.  
For the fi nal recommendation, it is advisable to use advanced GIS technology as 
open -source GIS has limitations. Advanced GIS technology is software that is not free to 
download and use but requires a subscription fee. Researchers can develop an advanced 
and more ac curate solution with advanced GIS technology.

User Manual  
 
 
1. Introduction  
The gravekeeper system aims to upgrade the inner workings of a Muslim 
cemetery. It can perform tasks such as plotting deceased records in a spatial 
object on a map. Using the map search feature, records can be quickly located. 
The system also supports cemetery services to facilitate the maintenance of 
graves. In addition, it includes features for tracking and maintaining cemetery 
records, such as information about the deceased, their fami ly members, and the 
details of their burial plots. This allows cemetery staff to quickly access important 
information about graves and burial plots. The gravekeeper system also provides 
tools for managing and organizing other aspects of cemetery operations , such as 
scheduling burials, managing burial plots, and tracking available grave spaces.  
2. Getting Started  
To get started, the user must have an open browser, such as Google Chrome, 
but preferably the latest version. After opening a browser, the user must n avigate 
to www.gravekeeper.website  (note: the website may be down at the time of 
reading this document if hosting has already expired).  
2.1. User Registration  
 
To use the system, the user must first register to create an account. To register, 
the user must provide the necessary information, such as their name, email, 

 
62 | P a g e  
 contact number, and the password they want to use. If registration is successful, 
the user will b e notified with a green banner. If it is unsuccessful, the form will be 
marked with red borders.  
2.2. Logging in  
 
To log in, the user must have an account. In the login field, the user can input 
their username/email and password that they provided during regis tration. After 
entering the correct credentials, the user will be redirected to their dashboard. For 
admin -level users, they will be redirected to the admin/admin aide dashboard.  
3. Admin / Admin Aide  
The admin role has access to the most crucial features of the system. The 
admin is in charge of inserting new records of the deceased, facilitating service 
requests, monitoring available grave spaces, and creating or setting the status of 
services. The admin and admin aide have almost the same functional access, with 
the only difference being that the admin has access to the shop and activity logs.  

 
63 | P a g e  
 3.1. Dashboard  
 
The admin dashboard contains information such as the availability of grave 
space, the number of occupied graves, and the number of pending and completed 
services. The map is also displayed as a reference to easily confirm the grave 
status.  
3.2. Records  
 
The admin can monitor all the deceased records that are registered and can 
insert new records or edit existing ones. Inserting a new record requires the 
person al information of the deceased as well as the information of the contact 
person or owner who will be responsible for the grave.  

 
64 | P a g e  
 3.3. Shop  
 
An admin can create a new service or edit an existing one. Services marked 
with a green label are available for users to request, while those marked with red 
are unavailable. Deletion is also possible. When creating a new service, the 
service name, fee, duration to complete, and starting availability are required.  
3.4. Order  
 

 
65 | P a g e  
  
Admins and admin aides are responsible for monitoring service requests. A 
request can only be placed in the active state after the requestor pays for it. A 
request in the active state means that it is being worked on and is expected to be 
completed based on the duration set for each service. Markin g the request as 
complete will notify the requestor via email, along with a digital receipt.  
3.5. Map 
 

 
66 | P a g e  
  
The map is programmed to be interactive; an admin can directly insert a new 
record by simply clicking on an empty burial plot. An image can also be inserte d 
for extra identification, and this can also be done by just clicking on the plot. The 
search feature in the map is functional; the grave can be located by searching 
using the deceased's name, and the system will mark the grave location of the 
search resu lt. 
3.6. Activity  
 
To track who interacted with whom, the activity section was created. The 
activity is a log of all admin and admin aide transactions and actions. This will be 
crucial when an issue arises, because the information in the activity log will be o f 
utmost importance.  

 
67 | P a g e  
 3.7. Account  
 
 
An admin can create a new account by themselves, and the account access 
level is set by the admin. The admin has the highest access in the system, followed 
by the admin aide/clerk, and finally, users have the lowest access.  However, users 
do not need higher access in order to make use of the system.  

 
68 | P a g e  
 3.8. Logging out  
 
To log out, the user icon must be pressed and a dropdown menu will pop up, 
where the logout option is located. Logging out will redirect the admin to the login 
page. 
4. Users  
Users have relatively lower system access, but that doesn't mean the system 
would be useless for them. The system was designed with the needs of the users 
as the highest priority during development, followed by the needs of the admin.   
4.1. Dashboard  
 

 
69 | P a g e  
  
 
 
A successful login will redirect the user to the user dashboard, where the history 
of requested services can be seen and the status of the request can be monitored.  

 
70 | P a g e  
 4.2. Request Order  
 
 
To request an order or service, the user must navigate to the sh op page, which 
displays all available services. To submit a request, the user must first fill out all 
required information in the fields, such as the grave number where the service is 
to be performed, the name of the deceased for additional confirmation, a nd any 
instructions the user may want to convey (adding instructions is optional and may 
not need to be filled out depending on the user's preference).  

 
71 | P a g e  
 4.3. Map 
 
The map in the user's view is only intended for search and tracking purposes, 
as is the map located on the homepage. However, features such as search, zoom -
out, and zoom -in are still available.  
4.4. Logging out  
 
Like the admin, users must also click the user icon and a dropdown menu 
will pop up, where the logout option is located. Logging out will re direct the user to 
the login page.
